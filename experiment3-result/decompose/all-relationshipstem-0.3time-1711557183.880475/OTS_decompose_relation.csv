#Description
The OTS is used by students and tutors where a tutor may also be a student. At registration, tutors need to provide their name, email address and bank account. After that, tutors may offer online tutoring in different subjects (e.g. mathematics, science, literature, etc.) by providing their level of expertise (e.g. primary school level, high school level, university level) in the given subject and their hourly price of a tutoring session (which may again be subject specific). Tutors may specify their weekly availability for tutoring sessions (e.g. Thursdays from 10:00 to 11:30).
Registered students (with a name and an email address) may browse available tutoring offers in a specific subject and then make a tutoring request from the designated tutor by specifying the level of tutoring. This request should suggest the target date and time of the first tutoring session. The tutor may confirm the requested tutoring session or offer a session at another slot. Once the session is agreed, the tutor and the student are expected to turn up at the given time for tutoring. During the tutoring session, the student and the tutor may agree upon to schedule follow-up tutoring sessions. After the actual tutoring session, the student pays for the session (with a credit card or wire transfer).
A tutoring session may be cancelled by either the student or the tutor. However, if the student cancels less than 24 hours prior to the session then 75% of the session's price has to be paid. If the tutor cancels within 24 hours then he/she needs to offer a 25% discount for his/her next session to the same student.

# Description
The Online Tutoring System (OTS) facilitates interactions between students and tutors. Tutors, who can also be students, register by providing their name, email address, and bank account details. They can offer online tutoring in various subjects, specifying their expertise level and hourly rates. Tutors also set their availability for tutoring sessions.

Students, with a name and email address, can browse tutoring offers and make requests from designated tutors, specifying the tutoring level and preferred session time. Tutors confirm or reschedule sessions. Both parties attend sessions and may schedule follow-ups. Students pay for sessions using credit cards or wire transfers.

Cancellation policies apply: students pay 75% if canceling within 24 hours, while tutors offer a 25% discount for next sessions if canceling within 24 hours.
