#Description
The OTS (Online Tutoring System) is a platform used by students and tutors. Tutors, who can also be students, register by providing their name, email address, and bank account details. They can then offer online tutoring in various subjects, specifying their expertise level (e.g., primary school, high school, university) and hourly price for each subject. Tutors also indicate their weekly availability for tutoring sessions.

Registered students have a name and email address. They can browse available tutoring offers in specific subjects and make tutoring requests to designated tutors, specifying the tutoring level and preferred date and time for the session. Tutors can confirm the request or propose an alternate time slot. Both parties are expected to attend the agreed-upon session. They may schedule follow-up sessions as needed.

After each tutoring session, the student pays using a credit card or wire transfer. Cancellations can occur, with penalties for late cancellations. If a student cancels within 24 hours, they must pay 75% of the session price. If a tutor cancels within 24 hours, they must offer a 25% discount on the next session to the same student.

#Description
The OTS (Online Tutoring System) is used by students and tutors where a tutor may also be a student. At registration, tutors need to provide their name, email address, and bank account. After that, tutors may offer online tutoring in different subjects (e.g. mathematics, science, literature, etc.) by providing their level of expertise (e.g. primary school level, high school level, university level) in the given subject and their hourly price of a tutoring session (which may again be subject-specific). Tutors may specify their weekly availability for tutoring sessions (e.g. Thursdays from 10:00 to 11:30).

Registered students (with a name and an email address) may browse available tutoring offers in a specific subject and then make a tutoring request from the designated tutor by specifying the level of tutoring. This request should suggest the target date and time of the first tutoring session. The tutor may confirm the requested tutoring session or offer a session at another slot. Once the session is agreed, the tutor and the student are expected to turn up at the given time for tutoring. During the tutoring session, the student and the tutor may agree upon scheduling a follow-up tutoring session. After the actual tutoring session, the student pays for the session (with a credit card or wire transfer).

A tutoring session may be canceled by either the student or the tutor. However, if the student cancels less than 24 hours prior to the session, then 75% of the session's price has to be paid. If the tutor cancels within 24 hours, then he/she needs to offer a 25% discount for his/her next session to the same student.
