#Description 
The Team Sports Scouting System is used by various employees of the club, including the head coach, the director of the club and the scouts. It is the role of the head coach to identify designated player profiles for future signings, which includes designated target positions for a player (e.g. GK for goalkeeper, LB for left back, etc.), and other player attributes (identified by a name and a value).

Scouts may note players a long list who seem to match a designated target profile at any time. This long list is periodically evaluated by the head scout when setting up scouting assignments for his team to investigate a specific player more thoroughly. As the completion of a scouting assignment, the scout submits a scouting report about the player, which includes the pros and cons of the player as well as a recommendation (e.g. key player, first team player, reserve team player, prospective player, not a good signing). 

After comparing first scouting results for a designated player profile, the head coach and the head scout decide upon which players to move to the short list. Several other rounds of scouting can be carried out for each short-listed player as part of scouting assignments-some of which is carried out by the head scout himself. If a player is finally recommended for signing by the head scout, the director makes an official offer for the player.

#Description 
The Team Sports Scouting System is used by various employees of the club, including the head coach, the director of the club and the scouts. It is the role of the head coach to identify designated player profiles for future signings, which includes designated target positions for a player (e.g. GK for goalkeeper, LB for left back, etc.), and other player attributes (identified by a name and a value).

Scouts may note players a long list who seem to match a designated target profile at any time. This long list is periodically evaluated by the head scout when setting up scouting assignments for his team to investigate a specific player more thoroughly. As the completion of a scouting assignment, the scout submits a scouting report about the player, which includes the pros and cons of the player as well as a recommendation (e.g. key player, first team player, reserve team player, prospective player, not a good signing). 

After comparing first scouting results for a designated player profile, the head coach and the head scout decide upon which players to move to the short list. Several other rounds of scouting can be carried out for each short-listed player as part of scouting assignments-some of which is carried out by the head scout himself. If a player is finally recommended for signing by the head scout, the director makes an official offer for the player.

#Description 
The Team Sports Scouting System is used by various employees of the club, including the head coach, the director of the club and the scouts. It is the role of the head coach to identify designated player profiles for future signings, which includes designated target positions for a player (e.g. GK for goalkeeper, LB for left back, etc.), and other player attributes (identified by a name and a value).

Scouts may note players a long list who seem to match a designated target profile at any time. This long list is periodically evaluated by the head scout when setting up scouting assignments for his team to investigate a specific player more thoroughly. As the completion of a scouting assignment, the scout submits a scouting report about the player, which includes the pros and cons of the player as well as a recommendation (e.g. key player, first team player, reserve team player, prospective player, not a good signing). 

After comparing first scouting results for a designated player profile, the head coach and the head scout decide upon which players to move to the short list. Several other rounds of scouting can be carried out for each short-listed player as part of scouting assignments-some of which is carried out by the head scout himself. If a player is finally recommended for signing by the head scout, the director makes an official offer for the player.
